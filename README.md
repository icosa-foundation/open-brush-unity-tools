## Open Brush Unity Tools
# Installation

Install by downloading the whole repository and opening it as a Unity Project

Or add to an existing project via the Package Manager: "Add package from git URL":  https://github.com/icosa-foundation/open-brush-unity-tools.git#upm
Note - you'll also need to add the UnityGLTF package: https://github.com/KhronosGroup/UnityGLTF.git unless your project already contains it.
